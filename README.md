# awstui

A terminal user interface (TUI) for interacting with AWS services, built with Go and Bubble Tea.

**DISCLAIMER**: This was my first attempt at "vibe coding". I wanted to see if it was as good/bad people are claiming it to be. I made some manually tweaks a well.

## Features

- Navigate and manage AWS resources (e.g., EC2, ECS, ECR).
- Interactive and responsive TUI experience.
- Lightweight and fast.

## Installation

To install `awstui`, make sure you have Go installed (version 1.16 or higher is recommended).

```bash
go install github.com/jhagofsk/awstui@latest
```

## Configuration

To use awstui, you will need to configure your AWS credentials. You can follow the same steps required of [aws-cli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli#configuration).

## Usage

After installation, you can run `awstui` from your terminal:

```bash
awstui
```

## Screenshots

_(Screenshots will be added here to showcase the TUI in action.)_
